# To Do List

> The "To do List" is a Microverse project where we get to practice all the things we've learned during the week. The "To Do List" project was made with webpack, it uses an HTML template to creat the /dis HTML index file. Also, when the window loads it will call a function that fills the list with the items on an array.
